## 🧠 How to Study Effectively: Techniques That Actually Work

University life is more than just lectures and exams. It’s a constant process of **finding your rhythm, your methods, and the best way to absorb knowledge**. During my first year, I tried different approaches — and here are the ones that really worked for me.

---

### 🕒 1. The Pomodoro Technique

The idea is to work for **25 minutes** without distractions, followed by a **5-minute break**. After four cycles, take a longer rest.

This method:
- prevents burnout;
- creates a sense of progress;
- helps avoid distractions like social media.

---

### ✍️ 2. Handwritten Notes

Even if typing seems faster, **handwritten notes are better for memory**. I keep a separate notebook for each subject, where I try to **rephrase content in my own words** instead of just copying from the board.

---

### 📚 3. Active Recall

Simply rereading lectures isn't very effective. Instead, try to:
- quiz yourself on the material;
- explain it out loud (even to yourself);
- use flashcards with questions and answers.

---

### 📅 4. Weekly Planning

Every Sunday, I prepare a **weekly plan**:
- what topics to study;
- what assignments are due;
- which deadlines are coming up.

This reduces stress and helps avoid last-minute cramming.

---

### 🤝 5. Studying with Others

Discussing topics with classmates is a great way to test how well you **actually understand** something. If you can explain it to someone else — you’ve truly learned it.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Effective studying isn’t about cramming all night. It’s about **consistency, awareness, and finding what works for you**. Try different techniques, experiment, and build your own rhythm. And remember — **quality matters more than quantity**.
