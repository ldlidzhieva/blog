## ✅ Study Week: June 22–28

Wrapping up my first exam session. Everything is behind me now: programming, calculus, and logic. Summer break is here, but my thoughts are still on learning.

🔍 This session, I:
- improved my problem-solving skills;
- learned how to structure knowledge effectively;
- realized the importance of consistent preparation.

Now I plan to strengthen my basics in C++ and SQL over the summer to start the next semester with more confidence. Studying is a marathon — and I really enjoy it 💪
