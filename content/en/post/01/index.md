## 📚 Study Week: May 25–31

This week I passed my first exam of the session — **Programming**. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but preparation really helped. We focused on solving problems with lists, dictionaries, and basic algorithms.

✏️ What came in handy:
- revisiting loops and conditionals;
- handling errors using `try-except`;
- testing with simple unit tests.

Last year's exam papers and task discussions with the instructor were incredibly helpful. I’m already starting to feel more confident in Python 💻
