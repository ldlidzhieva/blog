## 🧠 Study Week: June 15–21

I passed the **Mathematical Logic exam**! 🎉 It was challenging, but I managed to get through it. Reviewing the material with the instructor really helped — almost half of the topics overlapped with the exam.

📝 What was included:
- working with propositional logic;
- transforming logical formulas;
- checking the satisfiability of logical expressions.

Logic has now become one of my favorite subjects! I’m even thinking about exploring formal systems and the application of logic in programming more deeply.
