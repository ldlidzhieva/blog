## ðŸ“™ Study Week: June 8â€“14

This week was all about **logic**. Iâ€™ve been actively preparing for the upcoming **Mathematical Logic exam**. Weâ€™re covering statements, quantifiers, and predicate calculus.

ðŸ“– What I found especially interesting:
- building truth tables;
- transforming formulas into DNF and CNF;
- constructing proofs using resolution.

I started a dedicated notebook for logic schemes and formulas. Itâ€™s fascinating how logic sharpens abstract thinking. I really enjoyed the problems that require proving contradictions.
