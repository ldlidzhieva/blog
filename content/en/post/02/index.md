## ðŸ“˜ Study Week: June 1â€“7

I spent the entire week preparing for the **Calculus exam**, which took place on Friday. It's the most difficult subject for me â€” especially topics like limits and derivatives.

ðŸ“Œ What was on the exam:
- calculating limits of complex functions;
- applying L'HÃ´pital's rule;
- finding extrema;
- proving the convergence of sequences.

After the exam, I realized that consistent practice is the key to success. I wrote out notes by hand â€” it really helps to internalize the theorems.
